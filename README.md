# DPS Frontend Coding Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains a very basic web application based on Typescript and React. Main application file is `App.tsx`. Node and npm are required.

## Environment Setup

Ensure you have Node.js (v14.x or later) and npm (v6.x or later) installed.  
To set up and run the application, execute the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will then be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Context

You will be enhancing a new CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software aimed at managing customer data efficiently. Your task is to develop a feature that displays a searchable list of customers.

Refer to the attached mockup image to guide your UI development ðŸ‘‡

## Challenge Tasks

-   **Fork this project:** Start by forking this repository
-   **UI Implementation:** Implement the user interface according to the provided design mockup.
-   **Data Integration:** Utilize the endpoint https://dummyjson.com/users to fetch user data. If no filter is applied all data is displayed.
-   **Client-side Filtering:** Implement the following filters:
    -   **Name Filter:** An input field that dynamically filters by `firstName` or `lastName` as you type.
    -   **City Filter:** A dropdown that lists all cities present in the data. Users can select a city to filter the list accordingly.
    -   **Highlight Feature:** A checkbox that when checked, highlights the oldest users within each city (use data field `city`)
    -   **Optional:** Implement a 1-second debounce on the Name Filter input. This means the application should delay the filter action until 1 second has passed without any further input from the user. This optimization helps reduce the number of processing calls, enhancing performance.
-   **Submission:** After completing the challenge, email us the URL of your GitHub repository.
-   **Further information:**
    -   If there is anything unclear regarding requirements, contact us by replying to our email.
    -   Use small commits, we want to see your progress towards the solution.
    -   Code clean and follow the best practices.
